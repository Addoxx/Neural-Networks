# Neural-Networks
This project demonstrates four machine learning models on an abbreviated SVHN dataset with 32x32 pixel pictures. The training dataset has 10,000 images, whereas the testing dataset contains 1,000 images. Data models are as follows:

1. One vs One Linear SVM 
2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with no data augmentation 
3. CNN with data augmentation  
4. CNN with VGG architecture
